<b>Encryption</b> <br>
Encryption is the process of scrambling data so that only the desired party can understand that information. In more technical terms it is the process of converting plain text to cipher text.
<br>
  ```
  "Hello"  --->  [encryption]  --->  "SNifgNi+uk0="
  plaintext                          ciphertext
  ```
<br>

<b>Compression</b> <br>
Compression is the process used to reduce the storage space a file or program uses, this allowing more files to fit into the same amount of space. This process is especially useful when transfering files over the internet due to larger files taking a longer time to transfer.
<br> <br>

<b>Hashing</b> <br>
Hashing is the process in which an input is turned into a fixed sized value. Hashing, unlike encryption, has an output that cannot be reversed to form the key. This means that if a hacker gained access to the hashed database they could only gain access to the keys, which cant be reversed to gain the passwords. However, someone with the password can hash theirs and check it against the stored hash to gain access.

In modern time there are two main types of Cryptography algorithms used to protect our data over transfer, symmetric and asymmetric key encryption.

<br>
<b>Symmetric Key Encryption</b>
Symmetric key encryption, also known as a symmetric algorithm, is a type of encryption that uses one key to encrypt and decrypt data, a secret key, a public key and a private key. <i>"Keys are random bits that are used by the algorithm to transform the material into its encoded format and back to plain text." - ("Encryption 101", 2020)</i>. Some advantages to using symmetric key encryption include its encryption speed and efficiency for large projects with disadvantages cosisting of its need to keep the secret key, this can become tricky when dealing with multiple locations.


<br><li><b>Symmetric Key Ciphers</b>
<ol>- DES: A 64 bit block cipher that uses a 56-bit key.</ol>
<ol>- Triple DES (3DES): Uses three separate 56 bit encryption keys. The message is encrypted using one key, encrypted again using a second key and further encrypted by using either a first or third key.</ol>
<ol>- AES: A variant of [the] Rijndael [block cipher], with a fixed block size of 128 bits, and a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits. - ("Advanced Encryption Standard", 2020)</ol>
<ol>- Twofish: A symmetric block cipher which operates on 128 bit blocks and employs 16 rounds with key lengths up to 256 bits.</ol>
<ol>- Blowfish: A symmetric block cipher which operates on 64 bit blocks and employs 16 rounds with key lengths up to 448 bits and uses large key-dependant S-boxes [S-box: "<i>a basic component of symmetric key algorithms which performs substitution"</i> - ("S-box", 2020)].</ol>
</li>

<br>
<b>Asymmetric Key Encryption</b>
Asymmetric key encryption, also known as an asymmetric algorithm, is a type of encryption that uses two seperate keys, with one being used to encrypt and the other to decrypt data. The key pair being referenced as a public key and private key. The public key is used to send the message and the private key being the one to decrypt said message. Some advantages to using asymmetric key encryption include its encryption extended functionality and its scalability for larger projects with its main disadvantage being the speed of the algorithm.

<br><li><b>Asymmetric Key Ciphers</b>
<ol>- RSA: <i>"In RSA, the public key is generated by multiplying two large prime numbers p and q together, and the private key is generated through a different process involving p and q. A user can then distribute his public key pq, and anyone wishing to send the user a message would encrypt their message using the public key... When the user receives the encrypted message, they decrypt it using the private key and can read the original text."</i> - (Katz et al., 2020)</ol>

<h2> Visual Communication </h2>

<li><i>Criteria: 
  <ol>
    - how useability principles are used to inform solution development
  </ol>
  <ol>
    - how the elements and principles of visual communication inform user interface development
   </ol>
</i></li>

<br>

<b>Useability Principles</b> <br>
There are seven main useability principles that will be focused on, hierachy, harmony, contrast, repetition, alignment, proximity and balance. The combination of these priciples help the users navigate though a webpage with ease giving them the best experience and allowing them to know how the webpage is meant to be used. These principles help visually and practically for the user with the use of colour design all the way to easy navigation for the blind (using screen readers)

<ol>- Alignment: .</ol>
